### ðŸ©º Medical Chatbot using NLP
This project is all about building an intelligent Medical Chatbot that provides helpful and accurate information related to four major health conditions: Breast Cancer, Blood Pressure, Lung Cancer, and Diabetes.

For each disease, the chatbot offers detailed responses about:

Symptoms

Prevention methods

Causes

Lifestyle tips after diagnosis

The chatbot is powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), making it capable of understanding user queries and responding in a conversational manner. It's designed to be informative, user-friendly, and supportiveâ€”like a mini health assistant in your pocket.
